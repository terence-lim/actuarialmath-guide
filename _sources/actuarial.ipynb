    "# Actuarial Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The `actuarialmath` package is written in and requires Python (currently: version 3.10). Though the comparable R language possesses other desirable qualities, object-oriented programming is more straightforward in Python: since our sequence of actuarial concepts logically build upon each other, they are naturally developed as a hieararchy of Python classes with inherited methods and properties. \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section of this document introduces a class, along with the actuarial concepts it implements, arranged logically in three groups. To use the package, a suitable subclass should first be selected from the last group to load the given actuarial assumptions. Then the appropriate computational methods can be called, which may be inherited from the other general classes or make use of any shortcut formulas that can be obtained from the specific survival model assumed.\n",
