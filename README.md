__actuarialmath -- Life Contingent Risks with Python__

This package implements fundamental methods for modeling life contingent risks, and closely follows traditional topics covered in actuarial exams and standard texts such as the "Fundamentals of Actuarial Math - Long-term" exam syllabus by the Society of Actuaries, and "Actuarial Mathematics for Life Contingent Risks" by Dickson, Hardy and Waters.

This tutorial introduces the actuarial concepts hierarchically, and describes the corresponding derived Python classes. It is hoped that the use of this package can support a learner's journey through actuarial problem-solving and computing.
